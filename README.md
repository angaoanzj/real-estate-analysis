> Disclaimer: The scraping is for once-off data analytics only, we would not use it as a recurring script to get domain data.

For this particular project, we retrieve our data from Domain.

## Abstract
In this project, we focused on the real estate data for 500 regions in Victoria to analyse the changes in apartment's price from 2020 to 2021.

Then, we show our analysis among the filtered regionsâ€™ data and how it can be used to help the investor to make a wise investment.
