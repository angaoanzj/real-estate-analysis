From it, the investor can decide where to buy the apartment from 108 instead of 500 regions. Then, we consider the recovery ability of the real estate market in that region in the effect of the epidemic. We first find out the negative effect of the epidemic on the apartments' price is the most significant in 09/2020. Then, we consider the growth and decline rate of the apartments' price in 5/2021 compare with 9/2020. Except for regions with no sales volumes, we successfully narrow 108 regions into 26 regions. Next, by considering the price change month on month in regions that have the largest growth and decline rate in 26 regions, we show investor which regions are more suitable for investment compare with others. \n",
